# To-Do App
This To-Do app is my first mobile development project, as I had no prior experience. I relied on an online bootcamp, YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow, Google, and ChatGPT to build a strong foundation in Flutter. To start, I followed a YouTube tutorial by Pradib Debnath, which helped me create the base of the app. Along the way, I faced errors, so I researched solutions through Google and ChatGPT, troubleshooting them on my own. After completing the core features, I added an "About Me" page, making the profile image a navigation button using a solution from Stack Overflow. I then created about_me.dart to structure the page. While coding, I quickly learned state management with setState(), navigation with Navigator.push(), and handling user input using TextField. I used ListView.builder() to display tasks and experimented with styling using TextStyle and BoxDecoration. Additionally, I explored local storage with SharedPreferences, managed dependencies in pubspec.yaml, and improved my Git & GitHub workflow to organize my project. Once the app was fully functional, I refined the UI design to make it more appealing. This hands-on experience strengthened my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to learn quickly. I believe I am a strong candidate for the RISTEK mobile development division because of my dedication to learning and my ability to grasp new concepts quickly.
